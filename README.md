firerunner
==========

Firebug extension intended to open source files of web pages in running IDE like
Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA or another editor. It speeds up development productivity 
especially for large single-page projects. 
  Extension can be parametrized to execute anything with whatever argument so 
another usecases can be found.

Mechanism: 

1. Information about the source file is stored in HTML "info" tag (DIV tag is 
recommended and used by default). DIV can have zero size so it does not destroy the page 
layout or can be rendered conditionaly (if application is in debug mode) DIV must be marked 
in some way to be found by provided XPATH query (marking by property "class" is recommended). 
Multiple info tags can be placed on the page. Following form of info element is expected by default:

```html
    <div title="view:<path-to-source-file>" class="viewInfo">
```
2. Use "Filter" button of Firerunner extension to find info tags.
3. Click on the found link to open source file in specified editor/IDE.
